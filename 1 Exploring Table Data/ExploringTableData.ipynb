    "Developed by Riot Studios, League of Legends, or \"LoL\", is an online multiplayer\n",
    "video-game that is available to Windows/MacOS users. LoL consists 2 teams ('Blue\n",
    "& 'Red') facing each other, where the main objective is to destroy the opposing\n",
    "teams home base while facing obstacles throughout the way. Perks & gold are able\n",
    "to be obtained by players/teams through completing tasks such as eliminating\n",
    "players, enemy creeps, or dragons. Players then spend the gold to purchase items\n",
    "that help deal more damage towards enemies.\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends offers different game modes, such as ranked. A ranked game on\n",
    "average lasts 30-45 minutes. In this game mode, players are given a rank based\n",
    "off of the number of wins + the number of games played. \"Diamond\" is one of the\n",
    "highest ranks a player may obtain and is known to be extremely competitive. The\n",
    "dataset contains the first 10 minute analytics of each team for different\n",
    "diamond ranked matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the first 10 minute analytics of each team for different\n",
    "diamond ranked matches. Each team has 19 features (38 total) that include\n",
    "objectives such as creep score (CS), obtained dragons, total number of kills,\n",
    "etc. As for the instances, there is a total of 9,879 different diamond ranked matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is analyzed, teams/players would be able to conceptualize the\n",
    "level of priority different features/objectives have during early stages of\n",
    "diamond ranked matches. They could then use this information to adjust their\n",
    "strategy to one proven to win matches.\n",
