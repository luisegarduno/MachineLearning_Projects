    "#### <u>`About STL-10`</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html\" target=\"_top\"><b>CIFAR-10</b></a>\n",
    "dataset, STL-10 is a dataset containing a combination of images (gathered from\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/\" target=\"_top\"><b>ImageNet</b></a>)\n",
    "of animals and transportation objects. Within the dataset there are 6 animal & 4 transportation object classes:\n",
    "- __Animals__ : bird, cat, deer, dog, horse, monkey\n",
    "- __Transportation Objects__ : airplane, car, ship, truck\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 3 folders that will be used at specified times:\n",
    "- __Train__ : 5000 images used to train the algorithm\n",
    "- __Test__ : 8000 images used to test an algorithm (800 images per class)\n",
    "- __Unlabeled__ : 100,000 unlabeled image files\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from having not having identical classes, another difference between the datasets, is that the\n",
    "images in STL-10 are 3x's the resolution of CIFAR-10's images (96x96 versus 32x32).\n",
    "\n",
    "STL-10 is specifically an image recognition dataset. The dataset is intended to be used for developing\n",
    "unsupervised feature learning, deep learning, self-taught algorithms. That being said, the primary prediction\n",
    "task is to determine the type of animal or transportation object found in each of the pictures in the Unlabeled folder.\n",
    "Something that should be noted about the \"Unlabeled\" folder, aside from it containing the the classes mentioned above,\n",
    "it additionally includes other types of animals (bears, rabbits, etc.) and transportation objects[trains, buses, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>`Measuring Success`</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason this data is important is if trained correctly & the prediction task is achieved, third parties that\n",
    "use image captcha's for their websites, networks, etc. could use this data as a way to visualize how captcha's can\n",
    "be bypassed by __unsupervised__ feature learning, which essentially defeats the purpose of having a captcha test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this data to be of use to third parties using captcha's, I believe the prediction algorithm will\n",
    "have to render at least an 80% accuracy. The reason it isn't 90% is because if the prediction algorithm selects a\n",
    "wrong image, or doesn't recognize an image, often times captcha test's will let you get away with about 2 or less errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose & explain what metric(s) I will use to evaluate my algorithmâ€™s performance.\n",
    "- I should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data.\n",
    "- That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task).\n",
    "- (accuracy is RARELY the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.)\n",
